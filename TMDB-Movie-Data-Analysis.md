# TMDB Movie Data Analysis using Pandas and APIs

---

## Project Overview

This project challenges you to build a movie data analysis pipeline using Python and Pandas. You will fetch movie-related data from an API, clean and transform the dataset, and implement key performance indicators (KPIs).

This is not a group project, meaning you will design the workflow, structure the analysis, and implement the required calculations independently.

## Project Objectives

- **API Data Extraction:** Fetch movie data from a movie database API
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Process and structure the data for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an initial exploration to understand trends
- **Advanced Filtering & Ranking:** Identify the best and worst movies based on financial and popularity metrics
- **Franchise & Director Analysis:** Assess how franchises and directors perform over time
- **Visualization & Insights:** Present key findings using visualizations

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Fetch Movie Data from API

- Choose a movie database API (e.g., TMDb)
- Fetch movies with the following IDs:

```python
movie_id = [
    0, 299534, 19995, 140607, 299536, 597, 135397,
    420818, 24428, 168259, 99861, 284054, 12445,
    181808, 330457, 351286, 109445, 321612, 260513
]
```

- Store the data as a Pandas DataFrame

> **NB:** Read the API documentation to understand the nature of the data and how it's organized.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

#### Data Preparation & Cleaning

1. Drop irrelevant columns: `['adult', 'imdb_id', 'original_title', 'video', 'homepage']`
2. Evaluate JSON-like columns: `['belongs_to_collection', 'genres', 'production_countries', 'production_companies', 'spoken_languages']`
3. Extract and clean key data points:
   - Collection name (`belongs_to_collection`)
   - Genre names (`genres` → separate multiple genres with `|`)
   - Spoken languages (`spoken_languages` → separate with `|`)
   - Production countries (`production_countries` → separate with `|`)
   - Production companies (`production_companies` → separate with `|`)
4. Inspect extracted columns using `value_counts()` to identify anomalies

#### Handling Missing & Incorrect Data

5. Convert column datatypes:
   - `'budget'`, `'id'`, `'popularity'` → Numeric (set invalid values to `NaN`)
   - `'release_date'` → Convert to datetime
6. Replace unrealistic values:
   - Budget / Revenue / Runtime = `0` → Replace with `NaN` or infer from similar movies
   - Convert `'budget'` and `'revenue'` to million USD
   - Movies with `vote_count = 0` → Analyze their `vote_average` and adjust accordingly
   - `'overview'` and `'tagline'` → Replace known placeholders (e.g., `'No Data'`) with `NaN`
7. Remove duplicates and drop rows with unknown `'id'` or `'title'`
8. Keep only rows where at least 10 columns have non-`NaN` values
9. Filter to include only `'Released'` movies, then drop `'status'`

#### Reorder & Finalize DataFrame

10. Reorder columns:

```python
['id', 'title', 'tagline', 'release_date', 'genres', 'belongs_to_collection',
 'original_language', 'budget_musd', 'revenue_musd', 'production_companies',
 'production_countries', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'popularity', 'runtime',
 'overview', 'spoken_languages', 'poster_path', 'cast', 'cast_size', 'director', 'crew_size']
```

11. Reset index

### Step 3: KPI Implementation & Analysis

#### Identify the Best/Worst Performing Movies

1. Filter and rank movies based on:
   - Highest Revenue
   - Highest Budget
   - Highest Profit (Revenue - Budget)
   - Lowest Profit (Revenue - Budget)
   - Highest ROI (Revenue / Budget) — only movies with Budget ≥ 10M
   - Lowest ROI — only movies with Budget ≥ 10M
   - Most Voted Movies
   - Highest Rated Movies — only movies with ≥ 10 votes
   - Lowest Rated Movies — only movies with ≥ 10 votes
   - Most Popular Movies

> Define a **User-Defined Function (UDF)** to streamline ranking operations.

#### Advanced Movie Filtering & Search Queries

2. Filter the dataset for specific queries:
   - **Search 1:** Find the best-rated Science Fiction Action movies starring Bruce Willis (sorted by Rating — highest to lowest)
   - **Search 2:** Find movies starring Uma Thurman, directed by Quentin Tarantino (sorted by runtime — shortest to longest)

#### Franchise vs. Standalone Movie Performance

3. Compare movie franchises (`belongs_to_collection`) vs. standalone movies in terms of:
   - Mean Revenue
   - Median ROI
   - Mean Budget Raised
   - Mean Popularity
   - Mean Rating

#### Most Successful Franchises & Directors

4. Find the **Most Successful Movie Franchises** based on:
   - Total number of movies in franchise
   - Total & Mean Budget
   - Total & Mean Revenue
   - Mean Rating

5. Find the **Most Successful Directors** based on:
   - Total Number of Movies Directed
   - Total Revenue
   - Mean Rating

---

### Step 4: Data Visualization

Use Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize:

- Revenue vs. Budget Trends
- ROI Distribution by Genre
- Popularity vs. Rating
- Yearly Trends in Box Office Performance
- Comparison of Franchise vs. Standalone Success
